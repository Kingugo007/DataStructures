# Datastructures
After studying data structures and generic collections in the .Net.
I created generic Stack and generic Queue using linkedlist.
The case study is focused on how data is been used

# Stack 
Stack is a special type of collection that stores elements in LIFO style (Last In First Out). 
C# includes the generic Stack<T> and non-generic Stack collection classes.
It is recommended to use the generic Stack<T> collection.

# Queue
Queue is a special type of collection that stores the elements in FIFO style (First In First Out), exactly opposite of the Stack<T> collection. It contains the elements in the order they were added.
C# includes generic Queue<T> and non-generic Queue collection. It is recommended to use the generic Queue<T> collection.
